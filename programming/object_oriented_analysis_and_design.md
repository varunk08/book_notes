### Introduction
Process was based on functional modules.  
Limited reusability on change of process logic.  
Process is broken down into objects which can be independent of process changes.  

### Relationship between Classes
(in order of restrictiveness)
1. Association
2. Inheritance
3. Genericity (type parameterization)

#### Association
Arity (one-one, one-many)  
Aggretation/ composition (triangle composed of vertices)

#### Inheritance
